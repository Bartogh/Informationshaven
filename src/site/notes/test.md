**This does two things:**

-   The dg-home setting tells the plugin that this should be your home page or entry into your digital garden. (It only needs to be added to _one_ note, not every note you'll publish).
    
-   The dg-publish setting tells the plugin that this note should be published to your digital garden. Notes without this setting will not be published. (In other terms: Every note you publish will need this setting.)
    

7.  Open your command pallete by pressing CTRL+P on Windows/Linux (CMD+P on Mac) and find the "Digital Garden: Publish Single Note" command. Press enter.
    
8.  Go to your site's URL which you should find on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). If nothing shows up yet, wait a minute and refresh. Your note should now appear.
    

Congratulations, you now have your own digital garden, hosted free of charge!  
You can now start adding links as you usually would in Obisidan, with double square brackets, to the note that you just published. Remember to also publish the notes your are linking to as this will not happen automatically. This is by design. You are always in control of what notes you actually want to publish. If you did not publish a linked note, the link will simply lead to a site telling the user that this note does not exist.
